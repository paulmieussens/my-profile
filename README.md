# My Profile (simple student version)

How to open:

1. Double-click `index.html` or open it with any browser.
2. Edit text in `index.html` and colors in `style.css`.

Notes:
- Images use a placeholder (`https://i.pravatar.cc/120`). Replace with your own link or a local file in an `images/` folder.
- Code stays basic on purpose: plain HTML + CSS, no frameworks.
